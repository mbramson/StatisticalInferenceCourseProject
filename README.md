# StatisticalInferenceCourseProject

This project is the course project for the Statistical Inference class taught on Coursera by Brian Caffo of John Hopkins University.

The first part of the project deals with simulating a set of expontential distributions to verify the conclusions of the central limit theorem.

The second part of the project concerns analysis of the ToothGrowth data set. Exploratory data analysis is performed on the data and then conclusions using t-tests and confidence intervals are drawn.
